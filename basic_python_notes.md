## basic python knowledge
1. loop
    1. for item in l
    2. for idx, item in enumerate(l)
    3. for item in zip(l1, l2) # note zip takes iterables and return iterator, therefore it's memory efficient
    4. for key, value in some_map.items()
2. dividen / vs // (floor)
3. compare float number math.isclose(a, b, rel_tol=1e-5)
4. immutable(str,tuple) immutable(list, set, dict(**key in dict is immutable**)) 
5. function's default parameter is only evaluated once, therefore, **DON'T** use mutable as default parameter
6. scope LEGB(local, enclosure(non-local), global(global), builtin(\__builtins__))

### variables and data model
> for immutable types, operations that compute new values may actually return a reference to any existing object with the same type and value, while for mutable objects this is not allowed. E.g., after a = 1; b = 1, a and b may or may not refer to the same object with the value one, depending on the implementation, but after c = []; d = [], c and d are guaranteed to refer to two different, unique, newly created empty lists. (Note that c = d = [] assigns the same object to both c and d.)

### generator explain, this is very good
> A function or method which uses the yield statement (see section The yield statement) is called a generator function. Such a function, when called, always returns an iterator object which can be used to execute the body of the function: calling the iteratorâ€™s iterator.__next__() method will cause the function to execute until it provides a value using the yield statement. When the function executes a return statement or falls off the end, a StopIteration exception is raised and the iterator will have reached the end of the set of values to be returned.

```
def gen_func(num : int):
    print("###here")
    for n in range(num):
        yield n
       
n = gen_func(5)
print("after create gen func") # will print first
n.__next__() # now execute, and wait at yield n
```

### useful functions
`globals()` and `locals()` list the map of variables and builtins, etc

function has https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html to check the local variables and other things
